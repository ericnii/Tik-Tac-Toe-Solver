# Tic-Tac-Toe-Solver

This is a python tic-tac-toe solver that assumes perfect play and analyzes all possible moves to find who wins the given board.
This algorithm uses the graph data structure and a depth-first-search so find all possible moves. It supports 3x3, 4x4, and 3x5. 
Note that there are about 40000 game states for a 3x3 board, and a 4x4 board has about 85 million game states. 

The accepted format of the board is represented as: [["X", "", "O"], ["", "O", ""], ["X", "", ""]].
